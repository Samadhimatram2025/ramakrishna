        Sri Ramakrishna is regarded by millions all over the world as a divine incarnation. His early life was devoted to the practice and testing of spiritual disciplines including those of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam as well as the various subsets of Hinduism. After realizing God in each of those paths, he declared that all faiths, if followed with earnestness, lead to the same final goal.
